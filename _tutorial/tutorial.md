About
======
The goal of this half-day MICCAI2021 tutorial is to promote research of deep 2D/3D modeling and learning in medical image computing. Specifically, the participants will grasp a variety of ways in deep learning to close gaps between 2D and 3D imaging data which on the one hand facilitates the introduction of 3D prior knowledge during the learning of a 2D model, and on the other hand, enables the learning of 3D reconstruction from only a limited number of 2D images. We will begin with walking the attendees through several imaging systems that map the 3D world in the form of 2D or 3D imaging data. Then, we introduce how these imaging systems can be modeled as or incorporated into deep neural networks. Finally, we present several deep 2D/3D models that establish the connections between 2D and 3D data domains with deep neural networks and solve problems in computer vision and medical image computing
