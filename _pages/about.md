I am currently a graduate student pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, advised by Prof. Rama Chellappa. My research interest falls on the intersection between machine learning, computer vision, and their applications to medical imaging. Specifically, my work tries to leverage deep learning algorithms in tasks such as medical image reconstruction, synthesis, and artifact reduction. I am also in collaboration with Prof. S. Kevin Zhou of MIRCALE at CAS. 

Before I became a PhD student, I received a combined BS/MS in Electrical Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, with a focus on signal processing/communication systems. I TA'ed a bunch, and interned at various places such as Ericsson, Verizon, and Goldman Sachs during my time at UMD.
