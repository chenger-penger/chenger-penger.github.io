I am a CS PhD student at Johns Hopkins University, advised by Prof. Rama Chellappa. My research interest falls on the intersection between machine learning, computer vision, and their applications to medical imaging. In particular, my work tries to leverage deep learning algorithms to help improve image quality of CT/MR, or to provide additional information for various diagnostic purposes. I am also in collaboration with Prof. S. Kevin Zhou of MIRCALE at CAS. 

Before I became a PhD student, I received a combined BS/MS in Electrical Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, with a focus on signal processing/communication systems. During my time at UMD, I TA'ed a bunch, and interned at various places such as Ericsson, Verizon, and Goldman Sachs.
