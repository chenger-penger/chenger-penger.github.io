I am a Computer Science PhD student at Johns Hopkins University, advised by Prof. Rama Chellappa. My research mainly focuses on improving various asepcts of medical imaging acquisition to assist diagnostics, e.g. in CT/MRI reconstruction, super-resolution, artifact reduction, among other things. I have served as a reviewer for conferences and journals, including CVPR, ICCV, AAAI, MICCAI, TMI, Medical Image Analysis, etc.
